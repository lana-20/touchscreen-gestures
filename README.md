# Touchscreen gestures


Smartphones have relied heavily on gestures since the advent of multi-touch displays. When viewing photos, we no longer consider why we pinch and zoom, or why we pull down to refresh Twitter. As we interact with the content on our screens, we expect certain things to happen. There are more gestures than just the basic ones. The mobile ecosystem is filled with a variety of interactions, some of which are obvious, and some of which are hidden.

Gestures are the new clicks. Gesture-driven devices changed the way we think about interaction. The success of mobile applications depends on how well the gestures are implemented into the user experience.

The below image explains how the element (range slider) location can be calculated.

To ensure accurate and user-friendly interactions, touch-based GUI controls must be large enough to accommodate fingertip actions without small targets that may lead to frustration. What is the appropriate size for these controls?

Per [MIT Touch Lab study](http://touchlab.mit.edu/publications/2003_009.pdf), the average human finger pad is 10-14mm and the average fingertip is 8-10mm.

Apple, for example, recommends a minimum target size of 44 pixels wide 44 pixels tall for iPhones.

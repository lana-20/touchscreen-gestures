# Touchscreen gestures

Smartphones have relied heavily on gestures since the advent of multi-touch displays. When viewing photos, we no longer consider why we pinch and zoom, or why we pull down to refresh Twitter. As we interact with the content on our screens, we expect certain things to happen. There are more gestures than just the basic ones. The mobile ecosystem is filled with a variety of interactions, some of which are obvious, and some of which are hidden.

Gestures are the new clicks. Gesture-driven devices changed the way we think about interaction. The success of mobile applications depends on how well the gestures are implemented into the user experience.
